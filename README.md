# Capture EndNote Reference

Implementation of the **Capture Reference** bookmarklet by EndNote as a Mozilla extension. In an article webpage, click on the extension icon (instead of the bookmarklet) to launch the reference capturing process.

The original bookmarklet is available in the personal [EndNote account](https://www.myendnoteweb.com/), in the Downloads tab.
